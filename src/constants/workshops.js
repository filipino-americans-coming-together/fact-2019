  title: 'Mental Health and Self-Empowerment',
  description: '<p>“Umbrella can’t stop the rain, but it helps us stand in the rain. Confidence may not bring success, but confidence gives you the power to face any challenge in life.” Unknown Author</p><p>Most people, especially college students are bombarded with uncertainties, self-doubts, and limiting beliefs. These doubts and beliefs often reside in our heads for days and contribute to the negative experience to our mental health which often results in unnecessary anxiety, depression, and fear. Personally, I have been through this whole process as a college student, a person of color (Asian American), and a young professional. Fortunately, through years of the mentorship that I have received, researches and reflections that I have done, and hard works that I have put into self-experiment, I have come up with a toolset that I believe can assist college students to empower themselves and avoid the unnecessary mental health challenges that I went through as a college student. </p><p>The workshop I am proposing will show participants simple techniques to transform self-doubts and limiting beliefs into positive inspirations and resolutions. From these resolutions, participants will be able to use strength-based and person-based methods to set actionable goals to empower themselves. Participants will be more confident as they achieve their goals and be able to minimalize unnecessary self-doubts and limiting beliefs.</p>',

  title: 'Seeing past \'Walang Hiya\'',
  description: '<p>“Walang hiya ka” or “You have no shame” is a phrase that typically triggers a strong emotion within most Filipinx and Filipinx-Americans. It is a phrase that brings us back to our childhood, where the consequences of our actions determined whether we brought honor or disgrace to our family. Aside from choosing between eating adobo or hamburgers at lunchtime, Filipinx-Americans also have to choose between the collectivistic values of their Filipino culture at home and the individualistic values engrained in American society. In this workshop, we will unpack the meaning of “walang hiya” and other unintentionally hurtful phrases Filipino parents say that make it difficult for Filipinx-American individuals to cope between the intergenerational and intercultural conflict they experience. </p>',

  description: '<p>There is no health without mental health.

We are not training students to be clinicians; instead we are educating them on various common mental health and emotional knowledge, on how to be there for their friends, improve their communication skill, and on how to be a better listener for their friends.</p><p>Participants will explore their internal and external identities and how that may impact their own health and wellness. Participants will learn how to empower themselves through appreciation of their heritage and strengths.  After being able to identify who they are, participants will learn how mental health is an essential component of their personal development. Last, participants will learn about fellow Asian American perspectives and how this can increase their capacities to talk about their identities, mental health, and Asian American issues.</p>',
